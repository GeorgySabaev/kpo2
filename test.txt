Compacted Dirt is a naturally occurring material in the caves of Hoxxes.
It serves as an obstacle preventing passage through tunnels and caves.

This layer has the appearance of a dense ball of dirt.
It must be mined/destroyed in order for the mining team to make it past.
The hardness of Compacted Dirt is the same as the Common Rock for the biome,
except for biomes which have Common Rock with a hardness of 3,
in which case the Compacted Dirt will require 2 pickaxe hits instead of 3.
